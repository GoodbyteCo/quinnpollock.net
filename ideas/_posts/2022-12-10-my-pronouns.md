Some People find this a bit confusing. Basically it means that I use two sets of pronouns. Here is a little example of how to use my pronouns.

----

**She** went to the coffee shop.

I went with **them**.

**They** brought **her** own computer.

At least I think it was **hers**.

**They** bought **themself** a coffee and a pastry.
