I have made another a podcast. Are you queer? Do you like technology? Are you a tech worker? Are you conflicted about any of these? If so, Technically Queer is for you. Join hosts Alex, Bryan, Cass, and Quinn as this zany cast of they/thems explore the ways technology and queerness intersect, impact, and inform each other and the rest of the world. Comes with a healthy amount of cursing and a lot of horny, but only on the podcast.
